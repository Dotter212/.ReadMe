## Abstract 
Slang occurs in nearly every language. But is there a difference of use of slang between higher class and lower class? Understanding more about social differences will help us learn more about the use of slang. By creating a code that will count the frequency of the word gammon(a slang word) I will look through the differences in frequency of slang. 
This project will count the frequency of the slang word ‘gammon’ in a book written by a writer born in higher-class and one born in lower-class. The results will give insight about the use of slang in formal written language in different society classes.

## Research question and hypothesis 
How frequently was the word gammon used in written language by higher-class and lower-class British writers at the end of the 19th century?
The word gammon is more frequently used by lower-class than higher-class British writers at the end of the 19th century.
To narrow my research down I focus on written language from two English writers who wrote around the end of the 19th century. 

## Method 
in order to find out more about the slang words I choose to measure the frequency of one slang word. The word that I choose is the word ‘gammon’. (Jackosn, 2024) I got the word from this: https://www.victorianlondon.org/words/slang1870s.htm website. It’s a website called the dictionary of Victorian London. It was created by Lee Jackosn in 2001. It contains pages of primary sources which reveal the social history of Victorian London. 
I will count the use of the word ‘gammon’ and present it as a percentage of the total words used. I could also present it as a percentage of the word type. 
The first book I choose is Sons and Lovers by D. H. Lawrence. D.H.Lawrence was a English writer. He was born in 1885 and died in 1930. He comes from a working-class background who were in financial difficulties. I will use this book as data for the lower-class text. 
The second book is Just so stories by Rudyard Kipling. Rudyard Kipling is a English writer wo was born in 1865 and died in 1936. He was born in Higher-class. I will use this book as data for the higher-class text. 
Both The writers lived around the end of the 19th century and are born in England. The books I choose were in different genres, this could be a factor that influences the frequency of the use of the word gammon. 
Both of these books are from the project Gutenberg. Gutenberg is a project started by Michael Hart, which aims to distribute free eBooks. The books I choose are old enough that they don’t fall under the copyright law anymore, which is why I can make use of this data without any issues facing the law. 

## Questions/comments: 
- do I need to define lower and higher class? Do I need to argument that my writers are lower/higher class with literature or research from someone else?
- Is a token ratio to all the words the best option or from the total words from the same word type? (only the nouns) 
- gammon has two meanings, but most slang words do. 
- try to find books of the same genre to minimize the difference in other variables besides the social hierarchy. It would be great if I could find two writers who lived in the same region.
